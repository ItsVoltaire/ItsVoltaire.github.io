    <p>You wake up in a grassy plains. You're not sure how you got here, all you last remember was being sleepy in your friend's car as you were roadtripping to the next stop. The weather's a bit chilly and breezy. The grass around is high and thick, so it's a bit tough to see where you step. The plains seem to continue from the view straight ahead. To your left, you can see bundles and bundles of trees far ahead, and to your right you can faintly see smoke in the sky.<br>

Which direction do you go?</p>
