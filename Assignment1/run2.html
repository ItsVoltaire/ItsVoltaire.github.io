    <p>You attempt to run away from the vicinity, but the boar quickly hears your footstep and chases you down. You're running and running with all the energy you haveÂ and try to get the boar off your trail. Eventually, you slow down too much from fatigue, and the boar catches up to you and rams you over. As you're about to pass out after being knocked over, you can see the boar standing in front of you victoriously.</p>
